# The Theory Questions
1. The internet backbone refers to the high-speed data transmission lines that connect various networks and facilitate data exchange on a large scale.

2. Clients are devices that request and consume services or data from servers, while servers are computers or systems that provide services or data to clients upon request.

3. Servers, routers, switches, and workstations are interconnected through various networking hardware components to form the internet infrastructure. Servers store and serve data, routers direct data packets, switches facilitate local network communication, and workstations access and utilize network resources.

4. The TCP/IP model is a conceptual framework that outlines how data is transmitted across networks. It includes layers such as application, transport, internet, and link layers, with each layer responsible for specific functions to enable client/server communication.

5. Examples of internet services relying on client/server relationships include email (SMTP/POP), web browsing (HTTP), and file transfer (FTP).

6. Hypertext is text displayed on a computer or other electronic device with references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader can immediately access.

7. The web is a collection of interconnected documents and resources accessed via the internet through web browsers.

8. HTTP facilitates communication between clients and servers by defining how requests and responses should be formatted and transmitted over the internet.

9. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transmitting data between a web browser and a web server, while HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts data transmitted between the client and server.

10. Web 1.0 focused on static web pages, Web 2.0 introduced dynamic and interactive content, and Web 3.0 emphasizes semantic web technologies, artificial intelligence, and decentralized platforms.

11. Web 1.0 was primarily about publishing information online, Web 2.0 emphasized user-generated content and social interaction, while Web 3.0 aims for intelligent, context-aware applications and decentralized data ownership.

12. Markup languages like HTML and XML are used to structure and format content on the web, defining how elements are displayed or interpreted by web browsers.

13. Markup languages define the structure and presentation of content, while scripting languages add interactivity and functionality to web pages.

14. SGML laid the foundation for HTML and XML, HTML is used for structuring web content, XHTML is a stricter version of HTML, DHTML enables dynamic web content, and markdown is a lightweight markup language for formatting text.

15. My interests include technology, language, and education, along with a passion for learning and problem-solving.

16. CSE1210 could connect to my future occupational choices by providing foundational knowledge and skills in computer science, which could be applicable in various fields such as software development, data analysis, or cybersecurity.
